### How to Bypass the Great Firewall: Best eSIMs & VPNs for China

Why it makes money: High-commission affiliate links.

Monetization

- Affiliate: Promote Airalo or Holafly (eSIMs) and Astrill or ExpressVPN (VPNs). eSIMs are often easier to sell because they naturally bypass the firewall without needing a separate VPN client.
- Recommended affiliate approach: primary CTA for eSIMs (Airalo/Holafly) with a secondary CTA for VPNs (Astrill/ExpressVPN). Use UTM tags and track clicks/conversions.
- Disclosure: "We may earn a commission if you purchase through links on this page." Place near CTAs.

Key Focus: Comparison table of speed, price, and "ease of setup" for the top 3 eSIM providers.

Top eSIM providers comparison

| Provider | Typical Speed (network-dependent) | Typical Price (examples) | Ease of setup (1-5) | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Airalo | 4G/5G where available — usually fast | $4 (1GB short-term) — $30 (larger/longer plans) | 5 — in-app purchase + instant eSIM install | Large catalog, great for short trips, strong affiliate options |
| Holafly | 4G/5G — generally reliable | $8 (small) — $50 (unlimited/longer plans) | 4 — QR code or automatic install; some unlimited plans | Known for unlimited data plans, higher price but simpler UX for some users |
| Nomad | 4G/5G where available — competitive speeds | $5 (small) — $40 (bigger plans) | 5 — app/QR flow, very quick | Competitive pricing and flexible validity periods |

Notes on table data: speeds depend on local carriers used by each eSIM and user device/cell availability. Prices fluctuate by region and time — verify live prices via affiliate feeds or API when possible.

VPNs (short recommendations)

- ExpressVPN: Broad device support, consistently fast and reliable. Strong brand recognition — good conversion on trust.
- Astrill: Popular among travelers to China, known to be resilient; higher price point but often recommended for reliability.

Content & CTA suggestions

- Primary CTA: "Buy an eSIM for China — instant setup" (link to Airalo/Nomad/Holafly affiliate). Place near comparison table and at top of the article.
- Secondary CTA: "Get a VPN recommended for China" (link to Astrill or ExpressVPN affiliate).
- Add small step-by-step screenshots: purchase flow, QR install, and quickly testing connection.
- Add an affiliate disclosure near CTAs and in footer.

Tracking & Conversion

- Append UTM parameters to affiliate links for analytics (utm_source=site&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=china_esim_vpn).
- Consider affiliate deep links or partner APIs to show live price/availability.
- A/B test CTA copy and placement (e.g., "Instant eSIM — from $4" vs "Unlimited data plans available").

Legal & Safety notes

- Laws and enforcement change — include a short disclaimer that users should check local laws and the provider's terms.
- Avoid giving instructions that encourage unlawful evasion; focus on legal tools and affiliate offers.
